# Toolchain for publishing data models


## Motivation

To support the editors in creating and maintaining data models in a coherent approach tooling is required.

Data models have their own life cycle. 
For instance in the past the Core Vocabularies where created by different teams with different Work Groups at different times.
This had resulted in very similar but yet still distinct and sometime incoherent expressing between the Core Vocabularies.

To have them progress in the same way and same style tooling support is required. 
Certainly if one wants to provide the SEMIC community supportive additional artifacts around the Core Vocabularies, the impact on manual editing is high.
